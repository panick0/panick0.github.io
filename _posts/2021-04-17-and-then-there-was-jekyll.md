title:  "And then there was Jekyll!"
categories: jekyll

From a simple `README.md` to a bare bones static blog. Took a few days of research and then a couple of hours of making it work but now we're here!

Originally the plan was just to get Jekyll running locally and play around with it extensively before deploying any kind of site. I got a little excited to see if it would work online. So it does.

Now, the plan is to keep tinkering with it locally before releasing anything else.

With that said, next commit is coming soonâ„¢.
